    /// <para>gml:TimeTopologyPrimitive acts as the head of a substitution group for topological temporal primitives.
    ///Temporal topology primitives shall imply the ordering information between features or feature properties. The temporal connection of features can be examined if they have temporal topology primitives as values of their properties. Usually, an instantaneous feature associates with a time node, and a static feature associates with a time edge.  A feature with both modes associates with the temporal topology primitive: a supertype of time nodes and time edges.
    ///A topological primitive is always connected to one or more other topological primitives, and is, therefore, always a member of a topological complex. In a GML instance, this will often be indicated by the primitives being described by elements that are descendents of an element describing a complex. However, in order to support the case where a temporal topological primitive is described in another context, the optional complex property is provided, which carries a reference to the parent temporal topological complex.</para>
